git stuff:
- implement a cache system for git dependencies
	- cache dependencies as files in some cache folder
	- refresh cache if older than a day (?)
- git repo browser
	- add links (include some by default?) and see all matching file type files and pick and choose which to download
- git repo as a dependency
	- instead of needing to add all files individually, add one repo and it'll download all files present

general:
- add /task command, takes in the name of some task and does the thing, main macro waits for its completion
- depend/conflict with plugin specific settings (e.g. ST or pandora individual tweaks)

ui:
- indicate in the lua docs if a field has a setter
- have the language option be in the editor too
- way to bulk change macro settings (move to folder, change language, etc)
- show status of currently open macro

bugs:
- temp macros are added to the stack before the first finishes
